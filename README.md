# Quantum Thermo Chemistry (QTC) 

QTC includes modules that integrates open babel with quantum chemistry calculations and generates NASA polynomials in different formats.

It depends on:
  * Open Babel for cheminformatics (read/write chemical identifiers)
  * MOPAC, NWChem, Gaussian, Molpro for quantum chemistry calculations
  * MESS for calculating partititon function
  * RMG for generating a species list important for combustion chemistry
  * PAC99, thermp for format conversions
